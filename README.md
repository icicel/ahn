# NAMES AND PROPER WORDS

Names, or proper nouns, are written as-is. The entire name is treated as a symbol with respect to vowel placement, and can be part of carryback kerning.

- My name is Adam - R̄ äŕ̀'o Adam

- The Danube of the east - Iś̂ Danube'm ıś́̈"oı

- Sweden is a good place - Sweden'ö̀' d̂̂yn küt́

There are many proper nouns that are not names (noting that the definition of "name" is loose and can vary according to the translator's wishes). Non-names are translated as normally.

- Cold November weather - T̂un âĺryǵe ṕ̈ıśe

- Spread of Christianity - Oké̈n̂'m tsèoȷ̀̈àı̄

### NOUN SUFFIXES

The main two noun suffixes in English are the possessive suffix (-'s) and the plural suffix (-s). When used on proper nouns, they are translated into '-o' and '-a' respectively.

- Adam's steak - Adamo oı́̈h

- Several Volkswagens - Óĺëw Volkswagena

- The Johnsons' opinions - Iś̂ Johnsonao'k̀à̂̍o

The contraction of 'has' also counts as a possessive suffix.

- Evelyn's gone away - Evelyno d̂á̈'p̈̄

Should the proper noun end in a vowel, that vowel is replaced with the new suffix vowel(s). If it ends in several vowels, they're all replaced.

- My collection of Ferraris - R̄ t̂ú̧tȷ̀̂â'm Ferrara

- Da Vinci's Mona Lisa - Da Vinco Mona Lisa

- Many Colombias' worth of gold - R̈ā Colombao p̂eıŝ'm d̂un

Sometimes the proper noun and its suffixed form are identical. To distinguish in these cases, the vowel is dropped.

- It's Blorbo's fault - 'J͛̀o Blorb m̈̃wı

For the sake of legibility, the ending vowel should not be replaced in short names.

- Xi's bargain - Xio g̈ed̈̀a

- The Laos' attack - Iś̈ Laoao'ı̧̈th

### ARTICLE OMISSION

Some proper nouns, termed "weak proper names", are used along with the definite article 'the'. When translating these, the article should be dropped.

- Life in the Philippines - Ùḿ̀'a Philippina

- The BBC's shows - BBCo oŝpo

Regular proper nouns ignore this rule.

- The Addams family - Iś Addams m̈r̀ū

### NAME PHRASES

Whether proper noun phrases count as proper nouns in their own right varies depending on the context. In most cases, they don't count and are broken up into sub-words. These sub-words may include proper nouns but are otherwise treated as common words.

- The White House - Iś ps̀ı́ ŝ̃ó

- Yangtze River Valley - Yangtze èĺe l̈ú̧̄

Naturally, there are exceptions. They're usually cases where the name in question also has a commonly used acronym, for example the full names of organizations, companies, or some countries.

- The National Security Agency of the United States - National Security Agency 'm̂ United States

### PROPER MODIFIERS

Many name phrases contain certain adjectives or prepositions in them that describe the location or context of the head noun of the phrase. These are called "proper modifiers" and are sometimes shortened. The modifier is translated, stripped of vowels, and prepended to the following part of the name as if it were a prefix.

- South Africa - Oisafrica

- Papua New Guinea - Papua Apguinea

- Upper Himalayas - Kehimalay

Consecutive vowels are handled by inserting apostrophes, much like 'la' before words starting with vowels in French.

- Upper Egypt - K'egypt

In rare cases, nouns are also treated as modifiers.

- Saint George - Oaigeorge

### PROPER ADJECTIVES

Proper adjectives and other demonyms are usually derived from a proper noun, and are translated by suffixing '-e' to that noun. The suffix is applied in the same way as noun suffixes above.

- The French revolution - Iś Franc él̂ũȷ̀̂a

- Jovian moons - Jupitere r̂̂ao

- West Virginians' revenge - Poivirgineao éĺad́

- Freudian philosophy - Freude ks̀ŵôks̄

If the base noun is unclear, the word itself can be used as a proper noun.

- Basque country - Basque t̂̃aȷē

Other words derived from proper nouns are translated as common words.

- The spread of Buddhism - Iś oké̈n̂'m g̃yņs̀or

# TITLES

Titles are treated like proper nouns.

- Let's read Pride and Prejudice today - Úȷ͛o é̈n Pride and Prejudice ı̂n̈̄

Keep in mind that a title that begins with 'The' is not considered a weak proper name, and the 'The' should not be dropped.

- A review of The Shining -' É̈l̀́p̂'m The Shining

# ACRONYMS

Acronyms are treated mostly like proper nouns. However, noun suffixes do not replace the ending vowels and are just appended.

- Born in the USA - Ĝeà'a USA

- Their CPUs came later - Iś̀e CPUa ẗyŕ üȷ́e

If there would be consecutive letters as a result of this, the final vowel is removed anyway.

- NATO's defense - NATo ńyḿaó
