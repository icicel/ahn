# ĀĤN

Āĥn is a cypher from English.
It is also a separate language.
At least, it kind of looks like one.

This repo contains the source RegEx to the LingoJam translator that Āĥn was born out of.
It also contains the AHK script I use to edit Āĥn text.

# Grammar

## CONVERSIONS

### Consonants

### Vowels

### Letters with diacritics

## VOWEL CARRYBACK

### Paragraph-initially

### Carryback kern

## DUPLETS

### Separated duplets

### Combining duplet marks

### Inverted cedilla fix

## ADDITIONAL FORMATTING

### Dotless I

### Y insertion

### I/U conversion

To further aid in pronouncability, Is and Us in large groups of vowels are "converted" to their respective consonant "forms", J and W.
The standard method for doing this is as follows:
1. Convert all Us that are surrounded by vowels
2. Convert all Is that are surrounded by vowels
3. Convert all Us that are in front of another vowel
4. Convert all Is that are in front of another vowel
5. Convert all Us that are after another vowel

The converted Js are dotless, like the Is.
- beast - ǵ̈oı
- beasts - ǵ̈oȷo
- telltale - ı́w̧ȷ̈ú

### The You sign

## NUMBERS

## SYMBOLS

### Brackets

## CAPITALIZATION

The only allowed capitalization apart from in names or units (see relevant sections) is at the very first letter of a sentence.
Other than that, capitalization is ignored and the translated word is written in all lowercase.
- WHAT do you MEAN!? - Ps̈ı n̂ ¤ ŕ̈a!?
- oOPS I PRESSED CAPS LOCK - "K̂̂ò' kéó̧n ẗyko ûth
- capitalization is still optional - ẗyk̀ȷ̈ùb̈ȷ̀̂à'o oȷ̀û̧'kȷ̀̂äw

## NAMES AND PROPER WORDS

Names, or proper nouns, are written as-is, without any ignored capitalization or other standard formatting such as I/U conversion.
The entire name is treated as a symbol with respect to vowel placement, and allows for carryback kern.
- My name is Adam - R̄ äŕ̀'o Adam
- Sweden is a good place - Sweden'ö̀' d̂̂yn küt́

There are many proper nouns that are not names (noting that the definition of "name" is loose and can vary according to the translator's wishes).
Non-names are translated as normally.
- Cold November weather - T̂un âĺryǵe ṕ̈ıśe
- Spread of Christianity - Oké̈n̂'m tsèoȷ̀̈àı̄

### Noun suffixes

The main two noun suffixes in English are the possessive suffix (-'s) and the plural suffix (-s).
When used on proper nouns, they are translated into '-a' and '-o' respectively.
- Adam's steak - Adama oı́̈h
- Several Volkswagens - Óĺëw Volkswageno
- The Johnsons' opinions - Iś̂ Johnsonoa'k̀à̂̍o

The contraction of 'has' also counts as a possessive suffix.
- Evelyn's gone away - Evelyna d̂á̈'p̈̄

Should the proper noun end in a vowel, that vowel is replaced with the new suffix vowel(s).
If it ends in several vowels, they're all replaced.
- My collection of Ferraris - R̄ t̂ú̧tȷ̀̂â'm Ferraro
- Da Vinci's Mona Lisa - Da Vinca Mona Lisa
- Many Colombias' worth of gold - R̈ā Colomboa p̂eıŝ'm d̂un

Sometimes the proper noun and its suffixed form are identical.
To distinguish in these cases, the alternative suffix '-e' is used instead.
- It's Canada's fault - 'J͛̀o Canade m̈̃wı

For the sake of legibility, the ending vowel should not be replaced in short names.
- Xi's bargain - Xia g̈ed̈̀a

### Dropping the article

Some proper nouns are often used along with the definite article, 'the' (these are also called "weak proper names").
When translating them, the article should be dropped if present.
- Waters of the Nile - P̈ȷ́eô'm Nile
- Blue Nile waters - Gṹ Nile p̈ȷ́eo
- The Nile's waters - Nila p̈ȷ́eo

Regular proper nouns are unaffected, as are weak proper nouns in noun phrases.
- The Addams family - Iś Addams m̈yr̀ū
- The Nile of the east - Iś̂ Nile'm ıś́̈"oı

Any potential plural suffix is not converted to '-o', assuming the noun is referred to with its article.
Otherwise, conversion takes place as usual.
- Life in the Philippines - Ùḿ̀'a Philippines
- Too many Philippines - Î̂ r̈ā Philippino

### Name phrases

Whether proper noun phrases count as proper nouns in their own right varies depending on the context.
In most cases, they don't count and are broken up into sub-words.
These sub-words may include proper nouns but are otherwise treated as common words.
- The White House - Iś ps̀ı́ ŝ̃ó
- Yangtze River Valley - Yangtze èĺe l̈ú̧̄

Common exceptions are cases where the name in question also has a commonly used acronym, for example the full names of organizations, companies, or some countries.
- The National Security Agency of the United States - National Security Agency 'm̂ United States

### Proper modifiers

Many name phrases contain certain adjectives or prepositions in them that describe the location or context of the head noun of the phrase.
These are termed "proper modifiers" and are sometimes shortened.
The modifier is translated, stripped of diacritics, and prepended to the following part of the name as if it were a prefix.
- Papua New Guinea - Papua Apguinea
- Upper Himalayas - Kehimalaye

Dotless Is and Js are re-dotted.
- South Africa - Oisafrica

Consecutive vowels are handled by inserting apostrophes, much like 'la' before words starting with vowels in French.
- Upper Egypt - K'egypt

In rare cases, nouns are also treated as modifiers.
- Saint George - Oaigeorge
- Mount Everest - Rajeverest

### Proper adjectives

Proper adjectives, such as demonyms, are usually derived from a proper noun, and are translated by suffixing '-i' to that noun.
The suffix is applied in the same way as noun suffixes above.
- Jovian moons - Jupiteri r̂̂ao
- The French revolution - Iś Franci él̂ũȷ̀̂a
- Freudian philosophy - Freudi ks̀ŵôks̄

The suffix can be converted to '-j' according to normal rules.
- Not enough Swedes - Âı́'ẫds Swedenjo

If the base noun is unclear or too different, the word itself can be used as a proper noun.
- Gagauz language - Gagauz ẅad̃̈̍́

Other words derived from proper nouns are translated as common words.
- The spread of Buddhism - Iś oké̈n̂'m g̃yņs̀or

## TITLES

Titles are treated like proper nouns.
- Let's read Pride and Prejudice today - Úȷ͛o é̈n Pride and Prejudice ı̂n̈̄

Note that if a title begins with 'The', it should not be dropped as it is part of the proper noun itself.
- A review of The Shining -' É̈l̀́p̂'m The Shining

## ABBREVIATIONS

Abbreviations and contractions are translated as usual, but any full stops are removed.
Also, the Y insertion rules are ignored.
- That's Mr. Anderson - Is̈ȷ͛o re Anderson
- This USB is mine - Is̀õ'og̀'o r̀á
- He has multiple Ph.D.s - Ś s̈ö' ksno
- I'm a SaaS-based fintech sales analyst - "R̈̀͛' ö̈̍-g̈ón m̀aı́ts öẃö'äw̄oı

### Proper abbreviations

Abbreviations of proper nouns are not modified apart from removing the full stop if it's included.
- James R. Smith - James R Smith
- Born in the USA - Ĝeà'a USA

Additionally and specifically in the case of names, several abbrevations in a row are merged.
- The works of J. R. R. Tolkien - Iś p̂ehô'm JRR Tolkien

Abbreviated proper modifiers are unabbreviated and then handled as usual.
- W. Jefferson - Poijefferson
- Mt. Blanc - Raiblanc

Noun suffixes don't replace the ending vowels and are just appended.
If there would be duplets as a result of this, the final vowel is replaced anyway.
- SÄPO's mission - SÄPOa r̀ò̧̂a
- NASA's mission - NASa r̀ò̧̂a

### Units of measurement

When abbreviated, units of measurement count as proper nouns and are translated as such.
Unabbreviated units don't count.
- Only 5 km to Paris - 'Âw̄ 5 km ı̂ Paris
- Only 5 kilometers to Paris - 'Âw̄ 5 h̀ûŕȷ́eo ı̂ Paris
- 3V battery - 3V g̈ȷ̧́ē
- 3 volt battery - 3 l̂wı g̈ȷ̧́ē
